**NFT - Non-Fungible token**

**ERC721**-NFT standard, generated from CryptoKitties, is the earliest NFT asset construction protocol recognized by the Ethereum community. It is also the most widely used technical standard. It is evolved from the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-721 standard applies to collectible assets, such as Cryptokitties, which gives NFT assets cryptokitties ownership, issuing rights, and access control.

**ERC-1155**- a digital token standard created by [Enjin](https://enjin.io/) that can used to create both fungible (currencies) and non-fungible (digital cards, pets and in-game skins) assets on the Ethereum Network. By using the [Ethereum network](https://boxmining.com/ethereum/), ERC-1155 tokens are secure, tradable and immune to hacking. Different from ERC-721, ERC-1155 allows any type of NFT assets to be issued within the same smart contract, and different types of assets can be traded in multiple packages, which will effectively reduce asset transaction fees and optimize participants' trading experience.

**ERC-20** is the most popular token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the most popular token standard in the entire cryptocurrency industry. Unlike NFT, ERC20 is the FT standard, or homogenized token.

**Metaverse**- was first introduced in 1992 by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his book Avalanche.The word is a combination of two parts: meta meaning totality, and the suffix -- verse meaning place or world, similar to the concept of "universe."The meta-universe is one of the best applications of NFT.

**ETH** - Ethereum is a peer-to-peer network of public, open source virtual machines, a blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system with smart contract functionality.

**Decentralized wallet** - The private key of the decentralized wallet is kept in the user's own hand, and the assets are stored on the blockchain. The user is the holder of the real digital currency, and the wallet is just a tool to help the user manage the assets on the chain and read the data. Decentralized wallets are the primary storage tool for NFT. Well-known NFT-enabled decentralized wallets include MathWallet and others.

**Polkadot** - Polkadot is an open source project created by the Web3 Foundation to build a decentralized heterogeneous blockchain interoperability platform for Web 3.0.

**BSC** - BSC is a blockchain which runs parallel to Binance Chain. BSC has innovations in consensus algorithm. The PoSA (Proof of Stake Authority) consensus algorithm adopted by BSC combines the functions of DPoS and PoA mechanism, and is built on a network of 21 validators. Block producing in seconds enable high-speed infrastructure for the DeFi protocol.

**Heco** - Huobi Eco Chain (HECO) is a decentralized, efficient and energy-saving public Chain. It is also the first product launched by Huobi Open Platform. On the basis of supporting high-performance transactions, it realized the compatibility of smart contracts. The native digital asset of Huobi ecological chain HECO is HT, which adopts the consensus mechanism of HPOS.

**IPFS** -The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. IPFS support storage of documents, art assets, music, videos, social network information, photos, also distributed, secure storage for the front-end of some of the earliest Dapps.
